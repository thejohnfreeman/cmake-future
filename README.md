# cmake-future

A collection of extensions (functions and special variables) that I think
should be included in CMake.

## Install

### Linux

You'll need `sudo` to install these extensions in the right place. You can
read [the script](https://github.com/thejohnfreeman/cmake-future/blob/master/install.sh)
to see that it's very short and not dangerous.

```sh
curl -Lk https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thejohnfreeman/cmake-future/master/install.sh \
  | sudo bash
```
